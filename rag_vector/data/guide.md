# Guide to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in AI where a language model is augmented with external documents to improve the quality of its responses.

## How it Works
1. User sends a query.
2. The system retrieves relevant documents from a vector store.
3. The language model generates an answer using the retrieved context.

## Benefits
- Provides factual information from external sources.
- Reduces hallucination in AI responses.
- Can be updated without retraining the model.

## Conclusion
RAG is useful for applications like customer support, research assistants, and knowledge bases.
